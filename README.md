# The Fuck [![Version][version-badge]][version-link] [![Build Status][workflow-badge]][workflow-link] [![Coverage][coverage-badge]][coverage-link] [![MIT License][license-badge]](LICENSE.md)

*The Fuck* is a magnificent app, inspired by a [@liamosaur](https://twitter.com/liamosaur/)
[tweet](https://twitter.com/liamosaur/status/506975850596536320),
that corrects errors in previous console commands.


Is *The Fuck* too slow? [Try the experimental instant mode!](#experimental-instant-mode)

## Requirements

- python (3.5+)
- pip
- python-dev

##### [Back to Contents](#contents)

## Installation

On macOS or Linux, you can install *The Fuck* via [Homebrew][homebrew]:

```bash
brew install thefuck
```

On Ubuntu / Mint, install *The Fuck* with the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-pip python3-setuptools
pip3 install thefuck --user
```

On FreeBSD, install *The Fuck* with the following commands:
```bash
pkg install thefuck
```

On ChromeOS, install *The Fuck* using [chromebrew](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew) with the following command:
```bash
crew install thefuck
```

On Arch based systems, install *The Fuck* with the following command:
```
sudo pacman -S thefuck
```

On other systems, install *The Fuck*  by using `pip`:

```bash
pip install thefuck
```

[Alternatively, you may use an OS package manager (OS X, Ubuntu, Arch).](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/wiki/Installation)

<a href='#manual-installation' name='manual-installation'>#</a>
It is recommended that you place this command in your `.bash_profile`,
`.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or other startup script:

```bash
eval $(thefuck --alias)
# You can use whatever you want as an alias, like for Mondays:
eval $(thefuck --alias FUCK)
```

[Or in your shell config (Bash, Zsh, Fish, Powershell, tcsh).](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/wiki/Shell-aliases)

Changes are only available in a new shell session. To make changes immediately
available, run `source ~/.bashrc` (or your shell config file like `.zshrc`).

To run fixed commands without confirmation, use the `--yeah` option (or just `-y` for short, or `--hard` if you're especially frustrated):

```bash
fuck --yeah
```

To fix commands recursively until succeeding, use the `-r` option:

```bash
fuck -r
```

##### [Back to Contents](#contents)

## Updating

```bash
pip3 install thefuck --upgrade
```

**Note: Alias functionality was changed in v1.34 of *The Fuck***

## Uninstall

To remove *The Fuck*, reverse the installation process:
- erase or comment *thefuck* alias line from your Bash, Zsh, Fish, Powershell, tcsh, ... shell config
- use your package manager (brew, pip3, pkg, crew, pip) to uninstall the binaries

## Creating your own rules

To add your own rule, create a file named `your-rule-name.py`
in `~/.config/thefuck/rules`. The rule file must contain two functions:

```python
match(command: Command) -> bool
get_new_command(command: Command) -> str | list[str]
```

Additionally, rules can contain optional functions:

```python
side_effect(old_command: Command, fixed_command: str) -> None
```
Rules can also contain the optional variables `enabled_by_default`, `requires_output` and `priority`.

`Command` has three attributes: `script`, `output` and `script_parts`.
Your rule should not change `Command`.


**Rules api changed in 3.0:** To access a rule's settings, import it with
 `from thefuck.conf import settings`

`settings` is a special object assembled from `~/.config/thefuck/settings.py`,
and values from env ([see more below](#settings)).

A simple example rule for running a script with `sudo`:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('permission denied' in command.output.lower()
            or 'EACCES' in command.output)


def get_new_command(command):
    return 'sudo {}'.format(command.script)

# Optional:
enabled_by_default = True

def side_effect(command, fixed_command):
    subprocess.call('chmod 777 .', shell=True)

priority = 1000  # Lower first, default is 1000

requires_output = True
```

[More examples of rules](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/tree/master/thefuck/rules),
[utility functions for rules](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/tree/master/thefuck/utils.py),
[app/os-specific helpers](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck/tree/master/thefuck/specific/).

It is very important to write some Unit tests in file tests/rules, in order to reduce or prevent production bugs. It is also mandatory to add the new created rule in README.md file, in [How it works](#how-it-works) section, so all the users can understand what this rule does.

##### [Back to Contents](#contents)

## Settings

Several *The Fuck* parameters can be changed in the file `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/thefuck/settings.py`
(`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` defaults to `~/.config`):

* `rules` &ndash; list of enabled rules, by default `thefuck.const.DEFAULT_RULES`;
* `exclude_rules` &ndash; list of disabled rules, by default `[]`;
* `require_confirmation` &ndash; requires confirmation before running new command, by default `True`;
* `wait_command` &ndash; the max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output;
* `no_colors` &ndash; disable colored output;
* `priority` &ndash; dict with rules priorities, rule with lower `priority` will be matched first;
* `debug` &ndash; enables debug output, by default `False`;
* `history_limit` &ndash; the numeric value of how many history commands will be scanned, like `2000`;
* `alter_history` &ndash; push fixed command to history, by default `True`;
* `wait_slow_command` &ndash; max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in `slow_commands` list;
* `slow_commands` &ndash; list of slow commands;
* `num_close_matches` &ndash; the maximum number of close matches to suggest, by default `3`.
* `excluded_search_path_prefixes` &ndash; path prefixes to ignore when searching for commands, by default `[]`.

An example of `settings.py`:

```python
rules = ['sudo', 'no_command']
exclude_rules = ['git_push']
require_confirmation = True
wait_command = 10
no_colors = False
priority = {'sudo': 100, 'no_command': 9999}
debug = False
history_limit = 9999
wait_slow_command = 20
slow_commands = ['react-native', 'gradle']
num_close_matches = 5
```

Or via environment variables:

* `THEFUCK_RULES` &ndash; list of enabled rules, like `DEFAULT_RULES:rm_root` or `sudo:no_command`;
* `THEFUCK_EXCLUDE_RULES` &ndash; list of disabled rules, like `git_pull:git_push`;
* `THEFUCK_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION` &ndash; require confirmation before running new command, `true/false`;
* `THEFUCK_WAIT_COMMAND` &ndash; the max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output;
* `THEFUCK_NO_COLORS` &ndash; disable colored output, `true/false`;
* `THEFUCK_PRIORITY` &ndash; priority of the rules, like `no_command=9999:apt_get=100`,
rule with lower `priority` will be matched first;
* `THEFUCK_DEBUG` &ndash; enables debug output, `true/false`;
* `THEFUCK_HISTORY_LIMIT` &ndash; how many history commands will be scanned, like `2000`;
* `THEFUCK_ALTER_HISTORY` &ndash; push fixed command to history `true/false`;
* `THEFUCK_WAIT_SLOW_COMMAND` &ndash; the max amount of time in seconds for getting previous command output if it in `slow_commands` list;
* `THEFUCK_SLOW_COMMANDS` &ndash; list of slow commands, like `lein:gradle`;
* `THEFUCK_NUM_CLOSE_MATCHES` &ndash; the maximum number of close matches to suggest, like `5`.
* `THEFUCK_EXCLUDED_SEARCH_PATH_PREFIXES` &ndash; path prefixes to ignore when searching for commands, by default `[]`.

For example:

```bash
export THEFUCK_RULES='sudo:no_command'
export THEFUCK_EXCLUDE_RULES='git_pull:git_push'
export THEFUCK_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION='true'
export THEFUCK_WAIT_COMMAND=10
export THEFUCK_NO_COLORS='false'
export THEFUCK_PRIORITY='no_command=9999:apt_get=100'
export THEFUCK_HISTORY_LIMIT='2000'
export THEFUCK_NUM_CLOSE_MATCHES='5'
```

## Third-party packages with rules

If you'd like to make a specific set of non-public rules, but would still like
to share them with others, create a package named `thefuck_contrib_*` with
the following structure:

```
thefuck_contrib_foo
  thefuck_contrib_foo
    rules
      __init__.py
      *third-party rules*
    __init__.py
    *third-party-utils*
  setup.py
```

*The Fuck* will find rules located in the `rules` module.

## Experimental instant mode

The default behavior of *The Fuck* requires time to re-run previous commands.
When in instant mode, *The Fuck* saves time by logging output with [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_(Unix)),
then reading the log.

[![gif with instant mode][instant-mode-gif-link]][instant-mode-gif-link]

Currently, instant mode only supports Python 3 with bash or zsh. zsh's autocorrect function also needs to be disabled in order for thefuck to work properly.

To enable instant mode, add `--enable-experimental-instant-mode`
to the alias initialization in `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`.

For example:

```bash
